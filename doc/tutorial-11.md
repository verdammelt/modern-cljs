# Tutorial 11 - A Deeper Understanding of Domina Events

In the [latest tutorial][1] we introduced the ajax model of
communication between the browser and the server by exploiting the
[shoreleave-remote-ring][2] and [shoreleave-remote][3] libraries.

In this tutorial, prior to extending our comprehension of ajax in the
CLJS/CLJ context, we're going to get a better and deeper understanding
of a few features of DOM events management provided by the
[domina library][4].

To fullfill this objective, we're first going to line up the login
example introduced in the [4th Tutorial][5] with the more clojure-ish
programming style already adopted in the previous tutorials about the
Shopping Calculator example.

## Preamble

If you want to start working from the end of the [previous tutorial][1],
assuming you've [git][26] installed, do as follows.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/magomimmo/modern-cljs.git
cd modern-cljs
git checkout tutorial-10
git checkout -b tutorial-11-step-1
```

## Introduction

The following picture shows our old `Login Form` friend.

![Login Form][6]

As you perhaps remember from the [4th Tutorial][5], we desire to
adhere to the [progressive enhancement][7] strategy which allows any
browser to access our login form, regardless of the browser
capabilities.

The lowest user experience is the one offered by a web application
when the browser does not support JS (or it has been disabled by the
user). The highest user experience is the one offered by a web
application when the the browser support JS and the application uses
the Ajax communication model.

Generally speaking, you should always start by supporting the lowest
user experience. Then you step to the next layer by supporting JS and
finally you realize your last user experience enhancement by introducing
the ajax model of communication between the browser and the server.

Because this series of tutorials is mostly about CLJS and not about CLJ,
we skipped the layer representating the lowest user experience which is
based on CLJ only. Yet, we promise to fill this gap in successives
tutorials explaining the usage of CLJ libraries on the server-side.

# Line up Login Form with Shopping Calculator Form

The [9th tutorial][8] left to the smart user the charge of applying to
the *Login Form* the same kind of DOM manipulation used in implementing
the *Shopping Calculator*.

Let's now work together on the first step of this not so easy task we
previously left to you. We start by reviewing the html code of the
`login-dbg.html`.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
...
...
</head>
<body>
    <form action="login.php" method="post" id="loginForm" novalidate>
        <fieldset>
            <legend>Login</legend>
            ...
            ...
            <div>
              <label for="submit"></label>
              <input type="submit" value="Login &rarr;" id="submit">
            </div>
        </fieldset>
    </form>
    <script src="js/modern_dbg.js"></script>
    <script>
      modern_cljs.login.init();
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

> NOTE 1: The original and non-existent `login.php` server script is
> still attached to the form `action` attribute. In a later
> tutorial we're going to replace it with a corresponding service
> implemented in CLJ.

As you remember, when we reviewed the `Shopping Calculator` code to
make it more clojure-ish, we started by changing the `type` attribute
of the Shopping form's button from `type="submit"` to
`type="button"`. But having decided to adhere to progressive
enhancement strategy, this is not something that we should have done,
because a plain [button type][9] is not going anywhere without JS being
enabled in the browser. So we need to stay with the `submit` type of
button.

## First try

Start by making the programming style of `login.cljs` more
clojure-ish. First we want to remove any CLJS/JS interop call by using
[domina library][4]. Open the `login.cljs` file and change the `init`
function as follows.

```clojure
(defn ^:export init []
  (if (and js/document
           (aget js/document "getElementById"))
    (listen! (by-id "submit") :click validate-form)))
```

> NOTE 2: The [domina.events library][11] contains a robust event
> handling API that wraps the Google Closure event handling code, while
> exposing it in a idiomatic functional way for both the `bubbling`
> event propagation phase and the `capture` phase one.  In our login
> form example, by having used the `listen!` function, we have also
> implicitly choosen the `bubbling` phase. That said, in domina the
> `submit` type of event does not bubble up, and we then needed to
> attach the listener function (i.e. `validate-form`) to the `:click`
> event of the `submit` button, instead of attaching it to the
> `loginForm` as it was before.

Now compile and run the application as usual.

```bash
lein do cljsbuild clean, cljsbuild auto dev # compile just the `dev` build
lein ring server-headless # lunch the server from a new terminal
```

Then visit [login-dbg.html][12] and do not fill any field (or fill
just one of them). The application reacts by showing you the usual
`alert` window that reminds you to complete the form.
Click the `OK` button and be prepared to an unexpected
result.

Instead of showing the `loginForm` to allow the user to complete it,
the process flows directly to the default `action` attribute of the
form which, by calling an innocent server-side script
(i.e. `login.php`) return the `Page not found` message generated by
the ring/compjure server.

## Prevent the default

Take a look at the [domina/events.cljs][13] source code and direct your
attention to the `Event` protocol and to the private [HOF][14]
`create-listener-function`.

```clojure
(defprotocol Event
  (prevent-default [evt] "Prevents the default action, for example a link redirecting to a URL")
  (stop-propagation [evt] "Stops event propagation")
  (target [evt] "Returns the target of the event")
  (current-target [evt] "Returns the object that had the listener attached")
  (event-type [evt] "Returns the type of the the event")
  (raw-event [evt] "Returns the original GClosure event"))

(defn- create-listener-function
  [f]
  (fn [evt]
    (f (reify

         Event

         (prevent-default [_] (.preventDefault evt))
         (stop-propagation [_] (.stopPropagation evt))
         (target [_] (.-target evt))
         (current-target [_] (.-currentTarget evt))
         (event-type [_] (.-type evt))
         (raw-event [_] evt)

         ILookup

         (-lookup [o k]
           (if-let [val (aget evt k)]
             val
             (aget evt (name k))))
         (-lookup [o k not-found] (or (-lookup o k)
                                      not-found))))
    true))

(defn listen!
  ([type listener] (listen! root-element type listener))
  ([content type listener]
     (listen-internal! content type listener false false)))
```

Here is were you can find a beautiful clojure-ish programming style.  It
uses the anonymous reification idiom to attach predefined protocols
(i.e. `Event` and `ILookup`) to any data/structured data you want. Take
your time to study it. I promise you will be rewarded.

Anyway, we're not here to discuss programming elegance, but to solve the
problem of preventing the `action` login form from being fired when the
user has not filled the required fields.

Thanks to the programming idiom cited above, we now know that the
`Event` protocol supports, among others, the `prevent-default`
function which is what we need to interupt the process of passing the
control from the `submit` button to the form `action` attribute.

This application of the anonymous reification idiom requires that the
fired event (i.e. `:click`) is passed to the `validate-form` listener as
follows:

```clojure
(ns modern-cljs.login
  (:require [domina :refer [by-id value]]
            [domina.events :refer [listen! prevent-default]]))

(defn validate-form [e]
  (let [email (value (by-id "email"))
        password (value (by-id "password"))]
    (if (or (empty? email) (empty? password))
      (do
        (prevent-default e)
        (js/alert "Please insert your email and password"))
      true)))
```

> NOTE 3: Remember to add the `prevent-default` symbol to the `:refer`
> section for `domina.events` in the namespace declaration.

> NOTE 4: We took advantage of the necessity to update the `validate-form`
> function to improve its clojure-ish style. The semantics of the
> `validation-form` is now much more clear than before:
>
> * get the values of email and password
> * if one of the two is empty, prevent the form action form being
>   fired, raise the alert window asking the user to enter the
>   email and the password and finally return the control to the form;
> * otherwise return `true` to pass the control to the `default`
>   action of the form.

> NOTE 5: If you carefully watch the `validate-form` implementation you
> should note that the `if` branch traversed when its condition is
> `true` (i.e. when or the `email` or the `password` are empty), it does
> not return the `false` value regularly used to block the event
> propagation to the `action` attribute of the form. That's because
> `validate-form` is now internally calling `prevent-default` function
> and a returning `false` would become reduntant.

One last code modification in the `init` function and we're done.

```clojure
(defn ^:export init []
  ;; verify that js/document exists and that it has a getElementById
  ;; property
  (if (and js/document
           (aget js/document "getElementById"))
    (listen! (by-id "submit") :click (fn [e] (validate-form e)))))
```

> NOTE 6: Here, even if not needed, we wrapped the `validate-form`
> listener inside an anonymous function by passing it the fired `event`
> (i.e.`:click`) to make it clearer the mechanics of the listener. If
> you want you can can safetly unwrap the `validata-form`.

As usual, let's now verify our work by visiting the
[login-dbg.html][12] page. If you have stopped the previous
application run, execute again the usual commands from the terminal
prior to visit the [login page][12].

```bash
lein do cljsbuild clean, cljsbuild auto dev # compile just the `dev` build
lein ring server-headless # lunch the server from a new terminal
```

## Catch early react instantly

It's now time to see if we can improve the user experience of the
`loginForm` by introducing few more DOM events and DOM manipulation
features of Domina.

One of the first lessons I learned when I started programming was
that any error has to be caught and managed as soon as it manifests
itself.

In our `loginForm` context, *as soon as possible* means that the
syntactical correctness of the email and password typed in by the user
has to be verified as soon as their input fields lose focus (i.e.
*blur*).

### Email/Password validators

A pretty short specification of our desire could be the following:

1. As soon as the email input field loses the focus, check its
syntactical correctness by matching its value against one of the several
[email regex validators][16] available on the net; if the validation
does not pass, make the error evident to help the user (e.g. by
showing a red message, refocusing the email input field and making its
border red);

2. A soon as the password input field loses the focus, check its
syntactical correctness by matching its value against one of the several
[password regex validator][24]; if the validation does not pass, make some
evidence of the error to the user.

Although a nice looking implementation of the above specifications is
left to you, let's show at least a very crude sample from which to start
from.

> NOTE 7: Take a look at the end of [this post][23] for a HTML5
> compliant approach to password validation.

Open the `login.cljs` source file and start by adding two
[dynamic vars][17] to be used for the `email` and `password` fields
validation:

```clojure

;;; 4 to 8, at least one numeric digit.
(def ^:dynamic *password-re* #"^(?=.*\d).{4,8}$")

(def ^:dynamic *email-re* #"^[_a-z0-9-]+(\.[_a-z0-9-]+)*@[a-z0-9-]+(\.[a-z0-9-]+)*(\.[a-z]{2,4})$")
```

Now add the `:blur` event listener to both the `email` and `password`
input fields in the `init` function:

```clojure
(defn ^:export init []
  (if (and js/document
           (aget js/document "getElementById"))
    (let [email (by-id "email")
          password (by-id "password")]
      (listen! (by-id "submit") :click (fn [evt] (validate-form evt)))
      (listen! email :blur (fn [evt] (validate-email email)))
      (listen! password :blur (fn [evt] (validate-password password))))))
```

We have not passed the event to the new two listeners because, as opposed
to the previous `validate-form` case, it is not needed to
prevent any default action or to stop the propagation of the
event. Instead, we passed them the element on which the blur event
occurred.

Now define the validators. Here is a very crude implementation of them.

```clojure
(defn validate-email [email]
  (destroy! (by-class "email"))
  (if (not (re-matches *email-re* (value email)))
    (do
      (prepend! (by-id "loginForm") (html [:div.help.email "Wrong email"]))
      false)
    true))

(defn validate-password [password]
  (destroy! (by-class "password"))
  (if (not (re-matches *password-re* (value password)))
    (do
      (append! (by-id "loginForm") (html [:div.help.password "Wrong password"]))
      false)
    true))
```

I'm very bad both in HTML and CSS. So, don't take this as something to
be proud of. Anyone can do better than me. I just added few CSS classes
(i.e. `help`, `email` and `password`) using the [hiccups library][21] to
manage the email and password help messages.

To complete the coding, review the `validate-form` function as follows:

```clojure
(defn validate-form [evt]
  (let [email (by-id "email")
        password (by-id "password")
        email-val (value email)
        password-val (value password)]
    (if (or (empty? email-val) (empty? password-val))
      (do
        (destroy! (by-class "help"))
        (prevent-default evt)
        (append! (by-id "loginForm") (html [:div.help "Please complete the form"])))
      (if (and (validate-email email)
               (validate-password password))
        true
        (prevent-default evt)))))
```

Note that now the `validate-form` internally calls the two newly defined
validators and if they do not both return the `true` value, it calls
again the `prevent-default` function to block the `action` attached to
the `loginForm` to be fired.

Following is the complete `login.cljs` source code containing the
updated namespace declaration and referencing the introduced
[hiccups library][21].

```clojure
(ns modern-cljs.login
  (:require-macros [hiccups.core :refer [html]])
  (:require [domina :refer [by-id by-class value append! prepend! destroy! log]]
            [hiccups.runtime :as hiccupsrt]
            [domina.events :refer [listen! prevent-default]]))

(def ^:dynamic *password-re* #"^(?=.*\d).{4,8}$")

(def ^:dynamic *email-re* #"^[_a-z0-9-]+(\.[_a-z0-9-]+)*@[a-z0-9-]+(\.[a-z0-9-]+)*(\.[a-z]{2,4})$")

(defn validate-email [email]
  (destroy! (by-class "email"))
  (if (not (re-matches *email-re* (value email)))
    (do
      (prepend! (by-id "loginForm") (html [:div.help.email "Wrong email"]))
      false)
    true))

(defn validate-password [password]
  (destroy! (by-class "password"))
  (if (not (re-matches *password-re* (value password)))
    (do
      (append! (by-id "loginForm") (html [:div.help.password "Wrong password"]))
      false)
    true))

(defn validate-form [evt]
  (let [email (by-id "email")
        password (by-id "password")
        email-val (value email)
        password-val (value password)]
    (if (or (empty? email-val) (empty? password-val))
      (do
        (destroy! (by-class "help"))
        (prevent-default evt)
        (append! (by-id "loginForm") (html [:div.help "Please complete the form"])))
      (if (and (validate-email email)
               (validate-password password))
        true
        (prevent-default evt)))))

(defn ^:export init []
  (if (and js/document
           (aget js/document "getElementById"))
    (let [email (by-id "email")
          password (by-id "password")]
      (listen! (by-id "submit") :click (fn [evt] (validate-form evt)))
      (listen! email :blur (fn [evt] (validate-email email)))
      (listen! password :blur (fn [evt] (validate-password password))))))
```

To make the help messages more evident to the user, add the following CSS rule
to the `styles.css` which resides in `resources/public/css` directory.

```css
.help { color: red; }
```

Now compile and run the application as usual:

```bash
lein cljsbuild auto dev
lein ring server-headless # in a new terminal
```

Then visit the [login-dbg.html][12] to verify the result by playing with
the input fields and the login button. You should see something like
the following pictures.

![Email Help][18]

![Password Help][19]

![Complete the form][20]

## Event Types

If you're interested in knowing all the event types supported by
[Domina][4], here is the native code [goog.events.eventtypes.js][15]
which enumerates all events supported by the Google Closure native code on
which Domina is based on.

Another way to know which events are supported by Domina is to run brepl
and inspect the google library `goog.events/EventType` directly.  If we do
this in the domina.events namespace it will save some typing.

```clojure
Running ClojureScript REPL, listening on port 9000.
"Type: " :cljs/quit " to quit"
ClojureScript:cljs.user> (in-ns 'domina.events)
ClojureScript:domina.events> (map keyword (gobj/getValues events/EventType))
(:click :dblclick :mousedown :mouseup :mouseover :mouseout :mousemove
:selectstart :keypress :keydown :keyup :blur :focus :deactivate :DOMFocusIn
:DOMFocusOut :change :select :submit :input :propertychange :dragstart :drag
:dragenter :dragover :dragleave :drop :dragend :touchstart :touchmove
:touchend :touchcancel :beforeunload :contextmenu :error :help :load
:losecapture :readystatechange :resize :scroll :unload :hashchange :pagehide
:pageshow :popstate :copy :paste :cut :beforecopy :beforecut :beforepaste
:online :offline :message :connect :webkitTransitionEnd :MSGestureChange
:MSGestureEnd :MSGestureHold :MSGestureStart :MSGestureTap
:MSGotPointerCapture :MSInertiaStart :MSLostPointerCapture :MSPointerCancel
:MSPointerDown :MSPointerMove :MSPointerOver :MSPointerOut :MSPointerUp
:textinput :compositionstart :compositionupdate :compositionend)
ClojureScript:cljs.user>
```

Remember to visit [login-dbg.html][12] to activate the brepl before to
evaluate any expression in the brepl.

To complete the application of the progressive enhancement strategy to
the `loginForm`, in future tutorials we'll introduce [friend][22]
and line up the `loginForm` to the `shoppingForm` approach adopted in
the [10th tutorial][1] to allow the browser to communicate via ajax with
the server.

If you created a new git branch as suggested in the preamble of this
tutorial, I suggest you to commit the changes as follows

```bash
git commit -am "deeper understanding"
```

# Next Step - [Tutorial 12: The highest and the deepest layers][25]

In the [next tutorial][25] we're going to cover the highest and the deepest
layers of the progressive enhancement strategy to the Login Form.
